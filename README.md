# BubbleSortXElements

Used the bubble sort algo to sort max size of long long int array

I used the variable size in C, where the size of the array is computed at runtime.

It is inherently unsafe to do this in the C Programming Language and can only be used in certain places, but I thought it would be a fun idea to try it out.
